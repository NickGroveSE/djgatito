## Design Considerations

When I started designing this website for dj gatito I wanted to create a simple and seamless website that portrays her brand perfectly. The objective of the aesthetic choices was to depict dreaminess and cuteness, and to present the interface to the user as a living, breathing artifact. This is represented in many ways including the fluttering song artwork with its cartoon cupid wings, the pink metallic backdrop, the deep shadows, and the shades of cream and pink. Diversions from the main aesthetic in the form of social link colors and the design of the open and close player buttons was intentional to allow the user to easily discriminate the technological utility of the website from the artistic details.
